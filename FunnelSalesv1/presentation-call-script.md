## Audit Presentation Structure (20 minutes)

### **Section 1: Account Overview (3 min)**

> "Okay, starting with the big picture..."

**Cover:**
- Current monthly spend
- Platform(s) being used
- Campaign structure overview
- Current ROAS/CPA baseline
- Industry benchmark comparison

**Frame it:**
> "Right now you're spending $X/month with a ROAS of Y. For your industry, we typically see Z - so you're [above/below/at] benchmark."

---

### **Section 2: Biggest Issues (8 min)**

> "Now let me show you the 3-5 biggest issues I found..."

**For each issue:**

1. **Show the problem** (screenshot/data)
   > "See this campaign here? You're spending $X/day and the ROAS is only Y..."

2. **Explain the why**
   > "Here's why this is happening: [technical explanation]"

3. **Show the impact**
   > "This single issue is costing you approximately $X per month, or $Y annually."

**Example issues to cover:**
- Budget allocation problems (spending on dead campaigns)
- Poor creative testing cadence (or no testing at all)
- Audience targeting inefficiencies
- Attribution/pixel issues
- Campaign structure flaws
- Bid strategy mistakes
- Budget pacing issues

**Running total:**
> "So far we've identified $X in wasted annual spend just from these issues alone."

---

### **Section 3: What's Actually Working (3 min)**

> "It's not all bad news - let me show you what IS working..."

**Cover:**
- Top performing campaigns
- Best creatives
- Best audiences
- What to scale

**Frame it:**
> "This campaign right here is your goldmine. We need to do more of THIS and less of what we just looked at."

---

### **Section 4: Quick Wins (3 min)**

> "Now, here are 3-5 quick wins you can implement yourself TODAY..."

**For each quick win:**
- Specific action (turn off X campaign, increase budget on Y, etc.)
- Expected impact ("This should reduce your CPA by ~15%")
- Effort required ("Takes 5 minutes")

**Examples:**
- Kill specific losing campaigns/ad sets
- Reallocate budget from X to Y
- Update targeting on specific campaign
- Fix pixel/conversion tracking issue
- Adjust bid cap or ROAS goal

> "Implement these this week and you should see improvement within 7-10 days."

---

### **Section 5: 90-Day Roadmap (IF They Hire You) (3 min)**

> "Now, those are quick wins. But there's also some deeper stuff here that would take 2-3 months to fully optimize..."

**Show the vision:**

**Month 1: Foundation**
- Campaign restructuring
- Creative testing infrastructure
- Pixel/attribution fixes
- Audience research and build

**Month 2: Testing & Optimization**
- 3-5 new creatives per week
- A/B testing framework
- Audience refinement
- Budget scaling

**Month 3: Scale**
- Increase spend profitably
- Expand to new platforms (if applicable)
- Retention mechanics
- Full-funnel optimization

**Outcome:**
> "If we execute this right, here's where I think we can get you in 90 days: [paint specific outcome based on their goals]"

---

### **Minutes 20-25: Q&A**

**Transition:**
> "Okay, that's the full audit. What questions do you have?"

**Common questions & answers:**

**Q: "How long would this take to fix?"**
> "The quick wins - today. The full roadmap - 90 days to really see it working at scale."

**Q: "Can I do this myself?"**
> "Absolutely. I've given you everything you need. The question is: do you have the time and expertise? Most founders tell me they'd rather focus on running their business and let us handle the ads."

**Q: "Why is this happening?"**
> "Usually it's [specific to their account] - but the good news is, it's all fixable."

---

### **Minutes 25-35: Soft Pitch**

**Transition:**
> "So you have two options here..."

**Option 1: DIY**
> "Option 1: You take this audit and implement it yourself. You have all the information you need. The quick wins are straightforward, the longer-term stuff will take some expertise but you can figure it out."

**Option 2: We Do It**
> "Option 2: We handle everything for you - implementation, ongoing optimization, creative testing, scaling. You stay focused on running your business, we stay focused on maximizing every dollar you spend on ads."

**The Guarantee:**
> "Here's how we work: we guarantee a 30% ROAS improvement in 90 days. If we don't hit that, you don't pay our management fees - you'd only pay the ad spend itself, which you're already spending anyway."

**Pricing (adapt to your model):**
> "Our pricing is [explain your pricing structure]. For your account size, that would be approximately $X/month."

**The Ask:**
> "Is that something you'd want to explore?"

## Close Scenarios

### **SCENARIO A: "Yes, I'm interested"**

> "Awesome. Let me send you the proposal and pricing breakdown. When can you make a decision by?"

*[Send proposal, set follow-up date]*

> "Perfect. I'll send this over today. Take a look, and if you have questions, just reply to the email or we can hop on a quick call. Sound good?"

**Next steps:**
- Send proposal within 2 hours
- Follow up in 2-3 days if no response
- Close the deal

---

### **SCENARIO B: "Let me think about it"**

**Dig deeper:**
> "Totally understand. What specifically do you need to think about? Is it budget, timeline, or something else?"

*[Address concerns]*

> "No pressure. Here's what I'll do - I'll send you the proposal anyway so you have all the details. When do you think you'll have an answer?"

*[Set specific follow-up date]*

---

### **SCENARIO C: "I want to try it myself first"**

> "I respect that. Tell you what - implement those quick wins this week. Let's reconnect in 2-3 weeks and see how it's going. If you're seeing results, great. If you hit roadblocks or want help scaling, we'll be here."

*[Schedule follow-up call 2-3 weeks out]*

**Maintain relationship:**
- Send them the PDF audit
- Check in via email in 2 weeks
- Stay top-of-mind

---

### **SCENARIO D: "This isn't a good time / budget"**

> "I completely understand. When do you think would be a better time?"

*[If legitimate timing issue, schedule follow-up in 1-3 months]*

*[If budget issue, probe if it's real or objection]*

> "No problem. I'll check back in with you in [timeframe]. In the meantime, implement those quick wins and let me know how they perform."

---

## Handling Objections

### "Your pricing is too high"

> "I hear you. Let me ask - what would it be worth to you to [achieve their stated goal]? If we can get you there with a 30% ROAS improvement guarantee, does the investment make sense?"

*[Reframe as ROI, not cost]*

---

### "I need to talk to my partner/team"

> "Absolutely. What information do they need to make a decision? I'm happy to hop on a call with them too if that helps."

---

### "I just got burned by an agency"

> "I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"

*[Listen, empathize]*

> "Here's how we're different: [address their specific pain point]. And that's why we offer the guarantee - you're not taking the risk, we are."

---

### "Can you guarantee results?"

> "I can't guarantee specific numbers - anyone who does is lying. What I CAN tell you is every client I've worked with has seen measurable improvement within 60 days. And I showed you exactly what I'd do with your account - that's not theory, that's the plan."

## Pro Tips

1. **Show, don't tell:** Use their actual account data, not generic examples
2. **Be honest:** If something is working well, say so
3. **Create urgency:** "The longer these issues sit, the more money you lose"
4. **Anchor value:** "$2,500 audit for free" → makes your pricing seem reasonable
5. **Use their language:** Reference pain points they mentioned on discovery call
6. **Confidence:** You're the expert - act like it
7. **Don't chase:** If they're not a fit, let them go

---

## Red Flags (Consider Not Proposing)

- Can't make decisions (endless "I need to think about it")
- Unrealistic expectations ("I want 20x ROAS")
- Budget doesn't match needs
- Already churned through 5 agencies (probably them, not the agencies)
- Looking for lowest price, not best value
