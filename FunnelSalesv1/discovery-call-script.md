## If Lead Doesn't Qualify (Under $10k/month)

> "Thanks for sharing that. To be completely honest with you, at under $10k/month spend, the optimization opportunities are pretty limited and my services wouldn't be the best ROI for you."
>
> "What I'd recommend instead is [DIY RESOURCE or REFERRAL]. But when you're at $10k+/month and ready for serious scaling, reach back out and we'll revisit."

**End call professionally** - don't waste their time or yours.

## Common Objections & Responses

### "Why do you need access to my account?"

> "Great question. I can't do a real audit without seeing the actual data - campaign structure, creative performance, audience targeting, etc. All I can see is the same stuff you can see - I can't make changes, can't spend money, can't access billing. It's view-only. And you can revoke it anytime."

### "I'm not comfortable giving access yet."

> "I completely understand. The challenge is, without access, I can only give you generic advice. The whole value of the audit is showing you specific issues in YOUR account. How about this - grant me access now, I'll do the audit, and if you don't like what you see on the presentation call, you can revoke access immediately. Fair?"

### "Can you just tell me what to look for?"

> "I could, but it wouldn't be nearly as valuable. Every account is different - what's killing your ROAS might not be the same as the next brand. The audit is custom to YOU. That's why it's worth $2,500 normally."

---

## Red Flags (Consider Not Doing Audit)

- Spend under $5k/month (not worth your time)
- Can't/won't grant account access (they're not serious)
- Unrealistic expectations ("I need 10x ROAS tomorrow")
- Looking for free consulting (no intention to hire)
- Combative or difficult personality (nightmare client alert)

**Trust your gut.** Not every lead is worth your time.
